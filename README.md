<h3>Introduction</h3>

This is a website for students to find other students to work with, especially when large class sizes prevent them from finding collaborators. It adopts some functionality of Facebook Groups for classes, except that it's more casual in that there is one "feed" of posts that include a time, location, and class that someone is studying - anyone can filter the feed and see who has recently posted about a certain class or location. It uses websockets for real time updates of the feed and comments on posts, as well as messages for users. 

The beta version of the site was launched early Spring 2015 and requires a Berkeley email to join - it's currently dormant, pending changes to the design of the feed and status of other users. If you'd like to help with this project, feel free to contact me at chris.walter.0094 [at] gmail.
